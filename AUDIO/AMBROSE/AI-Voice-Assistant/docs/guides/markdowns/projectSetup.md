#### Create A Virtual Environment:
Before doing anything we should create a virtual environment in project directory. So, that dependency should not conflict with gloal packages.

**Windows/Linux:**

Run below command in project directory to create a virtual environment.

`> python -m venv <virtual-environment-name>`
>**venv** is a built-in module in Python that allows you to create lightweight, isolated Python environments. These environments are similar to virtual environments created by tools like Virtualenv
